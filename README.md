My experience as a Python developer includes backend web development (Django, FastAPI, REST/SOAP, SQL/MongoDB), Tkinter, and Analytics (Pandas, Excel/Openpyxl, Matplotlib, Jupyter). My concentration for my Master's degree was AI, but I was never impressed with ML or neural networks.   
<br>Currently exploring data analytics with Python.
