### Cris A. Fugate (Python Developer, Programmer Analyst üêç)

My previous job was at RedShelf (www.redshelf.com), first as a Full Stack Data Engineer, then Full Stack Engineer.<br>
In 2024 I couldn't find a job, so I tried freelancing for a year. That was not very successful.<br>
I thought that I was going to do real estate tech support, but the realtor fell ill, and I couldn't find another realtor who wanted support.<br> 
So, I am still searching for a new job, if anyone is still hiring in this market.

I have experience as a <b>Lead Programmer Analyst</b>. My experience as a <b>Python</b> developer includes <b>backend web development</b> (Django, FastAPI, REST/SOAP, JavaScript, SQL/MongoDB, Docker), <b>low-code Streamlit</b>, Tkinter, and <b>data analytics</b> (Pandas, Excel/Openpyxl, Matplotlib, Jupyter). My concentration for my Master's degree was AI, but not building modern ML. However, I do have experience using LangChain for <b>AI LLM integration</b>. I am also interested in working on <b>distributed systems</b>.
